1.When and why do we need Lazy()?

Ans:If we bundle all of our code in a single js file it will affect the performance of our website and slow it down.So we use lazy Loading to break the 
code into smaller chunks that can be fetched only when it is necessary in a seperate file.Thus increasing the performance of our website.



2.What is suspense ?

Ans:In the context of React, suspense refers to a feature introduced in React 16.6 to enable better handling of asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or code splitting. It allows you to suspend rendering a component until some condition is met, like data being loaded or a chunk of code being ready.

Here's how suspense works and how you can use it:

Asynchronous Data Fetching:
Suppose you have a component that needs to fetch data from an API asynchronously. You can use suspense to suspend rendering the component until the data is loaded.

Code Splitting:
Suspense can also be used for code splitting, where you dynamically load components only when needed to optimize initial load time.



3. Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the U wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?

Ans:The error indicates a synchronous update during component suspension, which can block the UI, violating React's design. Suspense, by providing graceful handling of asynchronous operations and fallback UIs, helps prevent UI blockage and ensures a smoother user experience. It encourages explicit management of asynchronous behavior, avoiding conflicts with synchronous updates.



4. Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?


Ans: Code splitting is a technique used in software development to improve performance and optimize the loading times of applications, especially web applications. It involves breaking down the application's codebase into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, rather than loading the entire codebase upfront. This pattern has several advantages and some potential disadvantages:

 **Advantages of Code Splitting**

 - Faster Initial Loading Times : One of the primary benefits of code splitting is that it reduces the initial bundle size that needs to be downloaded by users. This leads to faster loading times, especially on slower internet connections or mobile devices.

 - Improved Performance : Smaller bundles mean faster parsing and compilation times, which can lead to improved runtime performance. Smaller chunks of code can be parsed more quickly by the browser, resulting in a smoother user experience.

 - Optimized Resource Usage : Code splitting allows you to load only the parts of the application that are immediately needed. This helps in conserving network bandwidth and reduces memory usage, particularly for large applications.

 - Better Caching : Smaller code chunks are more cache-friendly. Once a chunk is loaded, it can be cached by the browser, leading to faster subsequent visits or interactions with the application.

 - Parallel Loading : Code splitting allows the browser to load multiple smaller chunks in parallel, taking advantage of the browser's ability to make multiple network requests simultaneously. This can further speed up the loading process.

 - Lazy Loading : Code splitting enables lazy loading of components or modules, which means that you can defer loading parts of your application until they are actually needed. This can significantly improve the perceived performance of your application.

 **Disadvantages of Code Splitting:**

 - Complexity : Implementing and managing code splitting can introduce some complexity to your build process and development workflow. Careful planning is required to ensure that code splitting is applied effectively and consistently.

 - Increased Network Requests: While parallel loading is an advantage, excessive code splitting can lead to a higher number of network requests. This could potentially slow down the application if not managed properly.

 - Dependency Fragmentation : Code splitting might result in the fragmentation of shared dependencies across different code chunks. This can increase the size of individual chunks if common dependencies are duplicated.

 - User Experience During Loading : While code splitting improves loading times, users might still experience loading delays when interacting with parts of the application that require loading new chunks. Proper handling of loading states and user feedback is essential to mitigate this.

 - Debugging and Tooling : Debugging code split applications can be slightly more challenging, as errors might occur in chunks that are not immediately visible. Additionally, some development tools and libraries might need additional configuration to work seamlessly with code splitting.

5) When do we and why do we need suspense?

   In React, the concept of "Suspense" is primarily used to improve the user experience by handling asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or code-splitting, in a more elegant and user-friendly manner. Suspense helps to manage the waiting state and provide fallback content while the asynchronous operation is in progress. Here are some scenarios where you might need and use Suspense in React:

-  Data Fetching :
   When fetching data from an API or server, there is typically a loading period where the data is being fetched. Suspense allows you to "suspend" the rendering of a component until the data is available, showing a loading indicator or fallback UI in the meantime. This prevents the user from seeing incomplete or empty content.

-  Code Splitting :
   Code splitting is a technique to split a React application's bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. Suspense can be used to handle the loading of these dynamically imported modules, showing loading indicators while the code chunk is being fetched, and then rendering the actual content when it's ready.

-  Lazy Loading Components :
   Similar to code splitting, Suspense can be used to lazy-load entire components or parts of the UI that are not needed immediately. This can help reduce the initial bundle size and improve the initial loading time of your application.

-  Image Loading :
   When loading images, especially large images or images from external sources, Suspense can be used to display a placeholder or loading spinner while the image is being loaded. This ensures that the user knows something is happening and that the interface is responsive.

-  Smooth User Experience :
   Suspense helps in providing a smoother user experience by minimizing abrupt loading transitions. Instead of suddenly displaying empty or partially loaded content, you can show a loading state or fallback UI, making the interaction more pleasant and understandable for users.

-  Error Handling :
   Suspense also enables better error handling in asynchronous scenarios. If an error occurs during data fetching or component loading, you can use Suspense boundaries to gracefully handle and display error messages to the user.

   Suspense is used in React to manage the waiting and loading states during asynchronous operations. It helps create a more user-friendly experience by showing loading indicators or fallback content while data is being fetched or components are being loaded, enhancing the overall usability and perceived performance of your React application.
