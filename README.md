Episode 6  contains all the code and assignment questions. I have used the Swiggy Live API to fetch data instead of hard coding the data.
Optimized filter and search capabilities.Have added a toggling Login button
Check it out at https://postmatesepisode06.netlify.app/ (You need to Allow the CORS Chrome extension to get the live API data)
Swiggy might update its live API in the future and the app may not work


Episode 7 contains all the code and assignment questions. I have fetched the menu of each restaurant from the live API and displayed it using a separate component. Routing has been added to all the components using react-router-Dom. Error element is also added

some restaurants might not be delivering at the time you view so an error might occur. Refresh the URL on that occasion


Episode 8 contains all the code and assignment questions. I have implemented the About section using class-based components. I have used this.state, this.setState to create and change state variables. I have used ComponentDidMount(),componentDidUnmount(), and componentDidUpdate() to display the life cycle of class-based Components. (P.s Class components are used only in legacy projects now)



Episode 9 contains all the code and assignment questions.I have included custom hooks for data fetching and to check if the user is online or Offline.Lazy loading is used to split the code for better performance.
Swiggy is constantly changing their live api so previous links might not work.check the site out in https://postmatesepisode09.netlify.app/
